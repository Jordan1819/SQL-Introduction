# SQL-Introduction
This is a project I made as an introduction to SQL. It employs simple relational database structure, several tables with multiple columns, different data types, and several simple example queries.

The query scripts included in this repo showcase the basics of creating, populating, and editing SQL relational databases as well as basic query structure with equality comparisons in the WHERE clause.

This project can be replicated by inserting and executing the query statements listed in an empty SQL database.
