# SQL-Introduction
This is a project I made as an introduction to SQL. It employs simple relational database structure, several tables with multiple columns, different data types, and several simple example queries.

The query scripts included in this repo showcase the basics of creating, populating, and editing SQL relational databases as well as basic query structure with equality comparisons in the WHERE clause.
